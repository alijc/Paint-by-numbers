<h2><a name="background">Background</a></h2>

Some time ago I wrote a <a href="../../games/puzzles.html">Java applet</a>
 that would let people play nonograms
(which were called 'Paint-by-Number' puzzles when I first met them).  I
then had to create a bunch of puzzles for people to solve.  I made 
extensive use of Steven Simpson's 
<a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/ss/software/nonowimp/">
nonogram</a> program to make sure that these puzzles had unique solutions.
<p>
Recently, I revisited that my old applet and revised it to deal with 
<a href="../index.html">color nonograms</a>
 (that is, puzzles with colors other than simply black and white).
Unfortunately, the nonogram program will not work with multiple colors.
As a matter of fact, the .non format that it uses will not even admit to
the possibility of the existence of such things.
<p>
So I decided to write my own.  The first thing to do was to read in an .xpm
file and figure out its row and columns keys would be.  That was pretty simple.
Next we had to forget what the picture looked like and solve it, using the keys
that we'd generated.  That turned out to be a bit harder.

<h2><a name="abandoned1">First abandoned algorithm</a></h2>

Well, actually, I thought that it'd be simple.  Simply run though every 
possible permutation of the colors in this image, and check each one to
see if it matches the keys.  The number of permutations should only be
<p><center><code>numColors * numRows * numColumns</code></center><p>
right?
<p>
Uh, wrong.
<p>
The actual number is 
<p><center><code>numColors<sup>(numRows * numColumns)</sup></code></center><p>
which is an entirely different kettle of fish.
<p>
I did write the code to do it, recursively looping through all rows, columns 
and colors, and successfully tested it with a little 2x3 test image, but 
when I tried it on this four-color 16x16 image...
<br><img src="./abc.gif" height="80" width="80" alt="ABC image"><br>
Well, let's see. <code>4<sup>(16 * 16)</sup></code> is .......1.340780793e+154.

<h2><a name="abandoned2">Second abandoned algorithm</a></h2>

So next I decided to attack the individual rows and columns instead of the
entire grid.  I'd run through all possible permutations of each row, compare
each against its key and select the ones that match.  Then I'd try every 
combination of the matching rows and find the ones that match the column
keys.
<p>
So, to start with, we need every permutation of a row of the image.
That's <code>4<sup>16</sup></code>, or, uh,  4.29497e+09.
<p>
I wrote this code up, just to see how bad it was, and it finished.
It took several minutes, but it finished.

<h2><a name="algorithm11">First acceptable algorithm for the first step</a></h2>

I took a step back, and realized that I wasn't going to solve this problem
by crunching numbers - I was going to have to manipulate strings.  So obviously
I was going to have to switch from C to Perl, er, I mean, C++, and the STL
string class.
<p>
So, after porting the code to read the xpm file and create the keys, I added
a function that, for each key, calculated the number of white spaces needed
to complete the row or column, counted the number of holes into which white
spaces could be inserted, and then inserted every possible permutation of
spaces into these holes.  This code ran in a fraction of a second.

<h2><a name="assembling">Next step, assembling the rows</a></h2>

Now that we've found all of the possible rows, all we have to do was to 
assemble every possible permutation of them and check each result.  In the
case of the ABC image, that's
<p><center><code>
15 * 105 * 105 * 13 * 105 * 286 * 105 * 105 * 14 * 105 * 286 * 286 * 16 * 16 *
105 * 14
</code></center>
<p>
or 2.1932685999e+26.
<p>
Ouch!

<h2><a name="algorithm21">First acceptable algorithm for the second step</a></h2>

OK, this isn't going to work.  So what do we try now?
<p>
What if we were to check the image as it's being built up?  Every time
we lay down a new row, we could make sure that the part of the image we
have so far still matches the column keys.  And if it doesn't, we don't
have to check any of the permutations that start with this combination
of rows.
<p>
This one works, mostly.  Here's a graph showing the time it takes to solve
39 of the 40 16x16 puzzles that I had made up.
<p>
<img src="al1-edited.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of first algorithm (edited)">
<p>
That doesn't seem so bad, does it?  One solution takes over a minute, but
the rest are pretty reasonable.
<p>
OK, let me put the edited-out value back in...
<p>
<img src="al1.gif" height="267" width="425" 
		alt="plot of first algorithm (unedited)">
<p>
Yep, you read that right. It's over five minutes. This is the offending image:
<p>

<h2><a name="algorithm22">
Second (sort of) acceptable algorithm for the second step</a></h2>

So what happens if we knock impossible possible columns out of the running the
same way that we're already knocking out impossible possible rows?  (Oh yeah,
did I mention that I've also assembled a list of possible columns, and am 
using them to determine whether the partial image is still possible?)
<p>
We can't remove the possible columns from the main store, since we need to 
keep the originals for when we work our way back up the stack out of our
recursions.  But we can make a new copy for each new row, let it erase the
columns that no longer fit and pass it on to the next row to be trimmed
a bit more.
<p>
The results of this algorithm were interesting, but not altogether satisfying.
<p>
<img src="al12.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of both algorithms together">
<p>
Note that the times for the two worst cases have been improved.  But some of
the other, previously reasonable, times have gotten very, very bad.  It seems
that for some images the extra overhead of making copies of the possible
columns more than outweighs the savings of having to check fewer columns.

<h2><a name="trimming">Cutting out the pikers</a></h2>

The next idea is to do some pre-processing, that is, to use the row keys to 
eliminate some of the possible columns, and visa versa.
<p>
So, for each row, we 'and' all of the possible permutations together.
What we're doing is looking at all of a row's possible permutations and 
looking for squares that are the same color in each.  That 
means that that square <i>has</i> to be that color.  (This is the 
mechanical equivalent to a person looking at the puzzle and muttering,
"Well, row #3 has a single black block 20 squares long, but there are
only 16 squares in the row, so the middle 8 squares <i>have</i> to be black.")
<p>
When we've done this to all of the rows, we end up with a matrix with many
squares of unknown color, but with some squares whose color we know.  We can
then check all of the possible columns and chuck the ones that don't match
what we know know about the image.  Then we can go on to solve the puzzle
using one of the two algorithms that we've already got.
<p>
But before we do this, we might as well cut down on the possible rows as well,
'and'ing all of the possible columns together and throwing out the 
rows that don't match.
<p>
When I coded this up (using algorithm #1) I got these times...
<p>
<img src="al12p1.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of both algorithms, plus the first algorithm, pre-processed">
<p>
Bingo!
<br>Let's look at that again, using a log scale to see what's going on 
close to zero...
<p>
<img src="al12p1-log.gif" height="267" width="425" 
		alt="same as above, with a log scale">
<p>
In nearly every instance, the extra processing to get rid of possible
rows and columns pays off.
<p>
Let's compare the times of both algorithms when the data's been pre-processed.
<p>
<img src="alp1p2.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of both algorithms, pre-processed">
<p>
I think we have a winner.

<h2><a name="trimming2">Cutting out yet more pikers</a></h2>

So let's throw algorithm #2 out, since it's not saving us anything anymore.
<p>
But there's still one more thing we can try to speed things up.  In the 
pre-processing step, we're using the row keys to eliminate some of the
possible columns and the column keys to eliminate some of the possible
rows, ending up with a subset of the original possible rows and columns.
We can repeat that step, using the reduced set of possible rows to further
reduce the set of possible columns, and visa versa.  We can do this ad 
infinitum.  Well not really, but we can do it until we reach a point
where we can't eliminate any more rows or columns.
<p>
So, I changed the program to pre-process the puzzle until it won't 
pre-process anymore, and then went on to solve it using the first algorithm.
<p>
<img src="alrp.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of first algorithm, repeatedly pre-processed">
<p>
OK, that's good enough.  I'm going to quit now.
<p>
But first I'll add a comment.  It was interesting to note that when I switched
to doing the pre-processing repeatedly, sometimes the puzzle actually got
solved in the pre-processing step.  I suspect, that for the original two-color
nonograms, this pre-processing might always be enough to solve the puzzle.
<p>
The reason that it can't solve multi-colored nonograms is because it doesn't
emulate the human reasoning completely.  Where a person can think, "By the 
row key I see that this square can be either black or white, while by the 
column key it must be either white or red.  Therefore, it must be white.",
this program can only mark it as 'unknown'.

<h2><a name="exercise">An exercise for the reader</a></h2>
<strike>
Remember a little while ago, when I said that this program can't completely
emulate human reasoning when solving multi-colored nonograms?  Well, I'm
thinking that it can be made to.  All it would take would be to add some
intelligence to the Image class, to be able to handle states like 'red or
white', in addition to the current valid states of 'red', 'white', 'black',
etc., or 'unknown color'.
</strike>
<p>
Never mind, I went and did this myself.  The pre-processing step now keeps
track of multiplicities of colors when trimming possible rows and columns.
Since this brings the pre-processing very nearly up to the level of what a 
human can do, I decided to print out the preliminary image in addition to any
final ones.

<h2><a name="source">The source code</a></h2>

Here's the final <a href="./pbnxpm.C">C code</a> (compiled with gcc 3.2.2)
<p>
And here's <a href="./pbnxpm.pl">another one</a> written in Perl (v5.8.0).  
This one uses the same algorithm, but the performance is somewhat different.  
For 'simple' puzzles, in which there are only a few hundred combinations 
of possible rows and columns, the Perl program typically takes 3 to 4 
times longer than the C++ program.  But for more difficult puzzles,
those having thousands of possible combinations, the difference in 
performance flips dramatically, with the Perl program doing in under a
minute what would take the C++ program a half hour.
<p>
And here's <a href="./pbnxpm.py">one in Python</a> (v2.2.2).  It's using the 
same algorithm, and is as complete as the Perl script, and ends up being even
faster.  I think I may have just become a convert.
<p>
And just because I don't know when to stop, here's <a href="./pbnxpm.rb">
another one in Ruby</a> (v1.6.8).

<h2><a name="compare">Comparisons between languages</a></h2>

Here are the final results for the two scripts (for the first set of 16x16
puzzles, along with another set of 20x20 puzzles), after I optimized the heck
out of both of them:
<p>
<img src="plpy16.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of Perl and Python execution times (16x16 puzzles)">
<img src="plpy20.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of Perl and Python execution times (20x20 puzzles)">
<p>
And just for comparison, here's the C++ results added in as well:
<p>
<img src="cplpy16.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of C++, Perl and Python execution times (16x16 puzzles)">
<img src="cplpy20.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of C++, Perl and Python execution times (20x20 puzzles)">
<p>
In this application, the major advantage that both Perl and Python have over 
C++ is their regular expression support.  And the advantage that Python has
over Perl is its ability to split regular expression pattern matching in 
two - to compile the regular expression once, and then do the pattern matching
many times.
<p>
And here are the results of the Perl, Python and Ruby scripts together:
<p>
<img src="plpyrb16.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of Perl, Python and Ruby execution times (16x16 puzzles)">
<img src="plpyrb20.gif" height="267" width="425" 
	alt="plot of Perl, Python and Ruby execution times (20x20 puzzles)">
<p>
Ruby, like Python, has the capability to compile a regular execution once
before matching it repeatedly.  But try as I might, I still couldn't get the 
Ruby execution times down to the level of the Python ones.  For the worst
puzzles, I couldn't even get the Ruby script to be as fast as the Perl one.
Now granted, I'd never looked at Ruby before (in other words, I'm a Ruby rube)
so that might merely be because of my inexperience.
